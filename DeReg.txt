DeRegisterer v. 0.4- a program to deregister WPS Classes

DeRegisterer is the result of the installation of the BonusPak from OS/2 Warp
3.0 on my computer.  I was a bit annoyed that it is so difficult to remove the
WPS classes from the system, so I wrote this program.  It's very simple, it
uses the WinDeRegisterObjectClass() API to do its work.  It doesn't destroy
any Objects derived from the deleted class or delete the corresponding dll, so
you have to do it on your own.  It has been tested at OS/2 2.1 and OS/2 3.0.
There are no known errors.

WARRANTIES:  NONE.

The program is freeware.
